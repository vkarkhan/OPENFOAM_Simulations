# CFD Simulation of flow of water-vapor in a Freeze Dryer

rhoSimpleFoam is currently used for steady state k-epsilon turbulence

OPENFOAM files for simulating water vapor flow. 
# Compressible RAS formulation
# Ideal Gas law
# Cp = 1850 J/kg-K
# mu = 1.34e-5 kg/m-s

Things to be done are:
# Repeat these simulations with k-w model
